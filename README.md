## First Express/Pug application, a basic introduction

This project is an initial toe dip into using Express and Pug. 

**Examples:**

* **Using a template:** all the `*.pug` files
* **Extending a template:** `account.pug` and `index.pug` each extend `layout.pug`
* **Rendering templates with variables:** the rendering of `\account` renders the `account.pug` template with interpolated variable input
* **Using inclusions:** `includes/header.pug` injected into `layout.pug`
* **Develop familiarity with Express web application framework**
